# BlockChain
In our Java-based project, we endeavored to replicate numerous functionalities of a blockchain within a user-friendly graphical interface. The project encompassed essential features such as Login and SignUp for user authentication, as well as a seamless Buy and Sell Coins mechanism to simulate real-world transactions. The incorporation of a Public Ledger enhanced transparency and traceability, providing users with a comprehensive view of transaction history. Additionally, we implemented a dynamic Coin rate fluctuation over time, introducing a realistic market element. To support these functionalities, we meticulously generated a database that ensures the integrity and persistence of user and transaction data.
